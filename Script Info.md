Script info (Legends Of Speed):

1. No ping toggle takes about 5 minutes to work
2. If you are using auto rebirth make sure to toggle it on and set your target rebirth BEFORE you turn the orb farm on
3. Auto Race V.3 might be bugged when using auto fill at the same time
4. anti-lag boosts ping so that there are less lag spikes
5. selling pets using auto sell will sell ALL pets within the pet type, so be careful!
6. The "gems" option in the auto farm is under the "orb type" dropdown because gems are classified as orbs in the game
